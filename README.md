# Cryptology Paper Template

This is a template for cryptologic papers, adapted from the macro set of Alex J. Malozemoff. When writing a new paper, you could fork this repository.

The `cryptobib` directory is a github submodule from [Cryptobib Export Repository](https://github.com/cryptobib/export) and it can be updated by running

```
git submodule update --init
```

The `cleveref` package offers the same functionality as the  reference commands in `crypto/crypto.sty`. If you prefer the `cleveref` package (like I do) then you could safely ignore those reference commands in `crypto/crypto.sty`.

Wish you implement your amazing ideas in a wonderful paper. Have fun.
