# Cryptology Paper Template

This is a template for cryptologic papers, adapted from the macro set of Alex J. Malozemoff. When writing a new paper, one could fork this repository.

The `cryptobib` directory is a github submodule from [Cryptobib Export Repository](https://github.com/cryptobib/export) and it can be updated by running

```
cd cryptobib
git pull origin master
```

I prefer to use the `cleveref` package so the reference commands in `crypto/crypto.sty` should not be used.

Wish you implement your amazing ideas in a wonderful paper. Have fun.
