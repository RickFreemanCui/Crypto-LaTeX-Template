\section{Technical Overview}
\label{sec-overview}

Summarize your work so that non-experts can get the main ideas by reading the Introduction and Technical Overview alone. They should be self-contained and within a 10-page limit. The original two-party authenticated garbling paper~\cite{CCS:WanRanKat17a} serves as an example for a good technical overview.
